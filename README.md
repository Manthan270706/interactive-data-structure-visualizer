# Interactive Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer

📋 **Project Overview**
A JavaFX-based educational tool that visualizes data structures and sorting algorithms in real-time. It helps students and developers understand algorithms through interactive animations and step-by-step execution.


## 🎯 Key Features

* **Data Structure Visualizers**

    * Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked Lists
    * Stack (push/pop animation)
    * Queue (Linear & Circular, enqueue/dequeue animation)

* **Sorting Algorithm Visualizers (8 Algorithms)**

    * Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Shell Sort
    * Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort

* **UI Features**

    * Dashboard with sidebar navigation
    * Responsive layout
    * Step-by-step controls, color-coded highlights, and operation descriptions
